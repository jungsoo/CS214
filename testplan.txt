Testplan - Multiprocessing Bank Server
    >> Jungsoo Park


Interesting test cases that stress the synchronous/multiprocessing nature of the server:

    1. Opening and starting an account from one client, then attempting to start
    the same account from another client. 
    >> This should keep the second client waiting until the first one finishes.

    2. One client opening a new account while another is credit/debiting to an
    account.
    >> Whichever client gets their respective lock first will be able to perform
    >> that action, while the other client will simply print out a message
    >> saying that it failed to lock their respective mutex.


Other test cases:

    3. Attempting to open more than 20 accounts.
    >> Will result in an error message.

    4. Debiting more than existing in the account.
    >> Will result in an error message.

    5. Starting a client without the server running.
    >> Will result in the client continuing to attempt every 3 seconds with an
    >> error message until the server becomes available.
