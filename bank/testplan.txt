Testplan - Multiprocessing Bank Server
    >> Jungsoo Park


Interesting test cases that stress the synchronous/multiprocessing nature of the server:

    1. Opening and starting an account from one client, then attempting to start
    the same account from another client. 
    >> This should keep the second client waiting until the first one finishes.

    2. One client opening a new account while another is credit/debiting to an
    account.
    >> Whichever client gets their respective lock first will be able to perform
    >> that action, while the other client will simply print out a message
    >> saying that it failed to lock their respective mutex.

    3. Two or more servers attempting to start on the same host.
    >> The first server will succeed, but any subsequent server start will fail,
    >> saying that the port is in use.


Other test cases:

    4. Attempting to open more than 20 accounts.
    >> Will result in an error message.

    5. Debiting more than existing in the account.
    >> Will result in an error message.

    6. Starting a client without the server running.
    >> Will result in the client continuing to attempt every 3 seconds with an
    >> error message until the server becomes available.

    7. Opening an account that already exists.
    >> The server will refuse and indicate that the account already is in
    >> existence.

    8. Starting an account that has not been opened.
    >> The server sends an appropriate error message to the client.

    9. Crediting/debiting a negative amount
    >> Crediting a negative amount is debiting the absolute value of the amount
    >> and vice versa for debiting.
